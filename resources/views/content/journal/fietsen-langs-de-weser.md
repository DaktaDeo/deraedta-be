My collegue Rogier De Langhe post an interesting link to a Podcast in the Microsoft Teams session for students Network Economy.
Curious as I am, I listen because he is one of my examples for truly understand the Platform Economy.

Since that time the episodes "Harvard Business Ideacast" are my partner when i walk or do the gardening. An episode is maximum 30 minutes. It's the perfect time for physical effort without load.
